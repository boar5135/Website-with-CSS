<h2><b>The Fight For Gender Equality in the Game: Empowering Women</b></h2> 
<p>Shortly after the US Women’s National Team sealed their 2-0 victory against the Netherlands in Lyon, France, the crowd began to chant “equal pay.” This did not come as a surprise considering the mounting political tensions surrounding the women’s game. Prior to the World Cup, a few key players on the USWNT filed a gender discrimination lawsuit. They claimed that there was a lingering institutional bias against women, because the women are paid significantly less than their men counterparts. In fact, The Wall Street Journal states that from 2016-2018, the women’s game generated even more revenue than the men’s. Yet, we still see a disappointing contrast between their wages. The USWNT members are using their World Champions platform to be a voice for women worldwide, and they are continuing to fight for gender equality and women’s rights as a whole. Young players look to them as role models as they represent soccer on the biggest stage possible. The fight continues.</p>
